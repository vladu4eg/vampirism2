		"elf_tips1"																		"<br><br><b>Elf Tips</b>
		<br>·You can build tent at the very start of the game near the troll base while you go search for a base. That way you will have a head start, just don't finish building it otherwise you won't be able to destroy it since the troll will be nearby. 
		<br>·Build your rock in the middle of the steps
		"
		"elf_tips2"																		"·You can use glyph on yourself to troll the troll for 10seconds
					<br>·Good towers early on can scare the troll away for good and give you time to dig dem gold mines. 2 towers are enough at the beginning!  Just upgrade it! 
					<br>·Don't foget to use your abilities! It's better to start with Root since it has a lower cooldown than Glyph. 
					<br>·Use glyph not only to save yourself from the desperate situation but to also prevent troll from farming
					<br>·Find a friend that will co-operate with you and build duo base. You will be two times as strong. 
					<br>·Right click the repair ability for an autocast repair, it will repair the closest building to you that has a health deficit! "
		"elf_tips3"																	"·Share your resources. If you have extra resources share them! Teamwork is needed in this game so the troll doesn't get farmed too fast! "
		
		"troll_tips"																		"<b>Troll/Wolf Tips</b>
					<br>·Make sure you don't die. If you die even once it's game over! 
					<br>·Every attack gives you gold depending on how much damage you did
					<br>·Buy items to become stronger! 
					<br>·You should replace items by selling them and buying better ones
					<br>·Always use your 1st skill (Reveal) to avoid wasting time finding Elves!. 
					<br>·Try to find enemies which do not have a lot of strong towers so it is easier to farm up
					<br>·Don't forget to upgrade your hut! Not only it will help you in a bad time, but it's also really good if you have wolves on your team. 
					<br>·You can use teleport and invis together. That way you will be able to teleport while being invisible. 
					<br>·Have fun trolling these small elves. 
					"
		"angel_tips"																		"<br><br><b>Angel Tips</b>
		<br/>·Donate gold to those who really need it, like the Elf who got attacked by the Troll at the beginning.. 
		<br/>·Don't let the Troll kill you! You've got lots of gold in your hands.                            
		<br/>·Always empty your pocket!  Give gold to players because the troll can steal it!               
        <br/>·You can assist players under attack by healing their wall or stunning the troll.
